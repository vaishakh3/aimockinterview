**AI Mock Interview using Python and Google Gemini API**

**Steps I followed:**

1. SpeechRecognition for transcription of speech input through microphone.
2. Provided base prompt to Gemini API. Base prompt is along the lines of "You are a Mock Interviewer.....".
3. Obtained Gemini API Key and implemented the API in my code.
4. The transcript is fed as input to Gemini API and the response is received.
5. PyGame and PyAudio is used to convert the response to speech and play it.
6. OpenCV is used to capture live video frames from webcam and display it. The transcript of User's speech and the response is also displayed in the Camera Window.

**How to use this project:**

1. Clone the repository.
